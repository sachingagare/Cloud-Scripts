##****--Auto-Scaling --****##

**-- create s3 bucket 
-- name it = "auto-bucket11"
-- grant public read permission
-- upload given "webs3" files (download and extract then upload to s3)
-- grant punlic read permission


**-- crate IAM role for s3 access
> create IAM role and name it = "s3role"
> provide s3 AdmistrativeAccess 


 ----Go to EC2 for following----
 
**-- Create LoadBalancer
> name it = "autobalancer"
> security groups = ssh , http.
 
**-- Auto-Scaling Groups
 -- crate launch configuration 
> select AMI 
> Configure details ->
   -> name it = "mylaunch" 
   -> select IAM role - s3role
   -> advance details --> 
   -->copy & paste "bootstrap script for s3 access" given in "Cloud-Scripts"
   -->put your bucket name in that script = "auto-bucket11"
> security group - ssh, http

 -- create auto-scaling group 
> group name = "autogroup"
> group size = 3 (select whatever you want) we will initially  start 3 instances
> subnet = 3 (select how many you want)
>advanced details ->
  -> load balancing = autobalancer (loadbalancer that we have created) 
  -> health check type = ELB (using loadbalncer, if not then EC2) 
  -> greace period = 150 sec (can change it)



   ----  types of auto-scaling 
 1) keep this gorup at it's intial size
 2) use scaling policy for adjust the capacity of this group

 1) keep this group at it's intial size -->
 > add notification ->
 -> send notification - name it - "teamAdmin"
 -> with this recipient - enter mail_id
 -> whenever instances - select when you want notification

> enter on create group and group is created 
 
> to check --> go to instances & check instace workinf using public ip
           --> check loadbalancer using public DNS 
           --> terminate any instance & check whether it will create instance automatically 
               to maintane always 3 instances

 2) Use scaling policy for adjust the capacity of this group 
 > select existing launch configuration - mylaunch     
 > create auto-scaling group >
  > group name = "autogroup2"
  > group size = 3 (initially we want 3 instances)
  > subnet - select all for this case
  > advance details -->
   --> loadbalancer = autobalancer
   --> health check = ELB
   --> grace period = 150 sec
  > scale between 3 to 6 (for this case you can select diffrent)
  > click on 'Scale the Auto Scaling group using a target tracking scaling policy'--
    
   ---inscrese group size ->  
    -> add new alarm - (all configuration for this case)
      - Send a notification to: select recipient for notification
      - whenever - Avarage - of - networkIn 
      - is >= 10 Bytes
      - for at least - 1 - consecutive period(s) of - 1 minutes
      - name it 
      - click on create alarm 
    -> take action - 
      - add - 1 - instance -when - 1o byte 
   
    ---decrease group size ->
    -> add new alarm - 
      - send notification : select
      - whenever - Avarage - of - cpuUtilization
      - is <= 10 percent
      - for at least - 1 - consecutive period(s) of - 1 hours
      - name it 
      - click on create alarm 
     -> take action -
       - remove - 1 - instance - when - 10 percent
     
   > click on configure notification
   > add notification - select recipient 
   > create tag - if needed
   > click on create group & it done 

>> to check working 
>> open terminal copy & paste public ip of any instance and connect to it 
>> paste - wget http://speedtest.ftp.otenet.gr/files/test1Gb.db 
>> press enter and check new instace is creating or not ... if yes it works ....
